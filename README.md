# WIP

Small web app that lets you search UMD courses by building, room, and time. Since the official website doesn't provide such functionality (and I would find use for it often).

Rest of README to come after some housekeeping tasks.

## TODO:
- clean up scrape scripts
- tests
- linter
- convert to typescript
- actual frontend
- autofill buildings
- deploy MVP
