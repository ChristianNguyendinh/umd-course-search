# WIP

Small web app that lets you search UMD courses by building, room, and time. Since the official website doesn't provide such functionality (and I would find use for it often).

To be integrated into my [UMD CS course registration tracker](https://github.com/ChristianNguyendinh/cs-upper-level-registration-stats) eventually.

Rest of README to come after some housekeeping tasks.

## TODO:
- tests
- convert to typescript
- linter
- logger
- actual frontend
- autofill buildings
- deploy MVP
- clean up old scrape scripts (i dislike my past self)
